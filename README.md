Third Commit (Khalil) - Enhanced the website's base design and interactivity:
                      - Modified the base.html file to improve the navigation bar's appearance and user experience.
                      - Navbar Hover Effect: Added hover effects on the navigation bar links, including a background color change to white and text color change to lighter blue (#007bb5) when the user hovers over them.
                      - Highlight and Border-Radius Effect: Added a subtle border-radius and highlight effect when hovering on the navbar links to make the navigation smoother and more visually appealing.
                      - Updated Color Scheme: Refined the color scheme, incorporating a light cyan background and complementary shades of blue for a modern, cohesive look.
                      - Improved Layout: Adjusted the layout for a cleaner, more user-friendly design.
